<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deproteinized Whey Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Separation (Membrane Filtration)</li><li>Chemical Separation (Ion Exchange)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The deproteinized whey market includes two primary separation types: physical and chemical. Physical separation, achieved through membrane filtration, uses semi-permeable membranes to separate proteins and fats from whey, resulting in a concentrated whey protein product with essential nutrients. In contrast, chemical separation, or ion exchange, utilizes charged resins to selectively remove proteins and other components based on their electrical charge, producing a highly purified whey product. Both methods cater to diverse applications in food, nutrition, and pharmaceutical industries.</p></p>
